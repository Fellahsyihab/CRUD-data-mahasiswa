# What is Codeiginiter ?
CodeIgniter is a PHP MVC framework used for developing web applications rapidly. CodeIgniter provides out of the box libraries for connecting to the database and performing various operations like sending emails, uploading files, managing sessions, etc.

# Compatibility
CodeIgniter recommends PHP 5.6 or newer to be used, but it should be compatible with PHP 5.3.7 so all code supplied must stick to this requirement. If PHP 5.4 (and above) functions or features are used then there must be a fallback for PHP 5.3.7.
